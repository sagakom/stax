Header builder for any WordPress theme. Replace your existing header and create pixel perfect headers with ease. All is visual and in front-end.

== Description ==

Stax is a drag & drop visual header builder plugin for WordPress enabling the creation of page headers in a live, visual way. This lets you focus on the look and design of your page headers, instead of tripping over the behind-the-scenes mechanics of building headers.
